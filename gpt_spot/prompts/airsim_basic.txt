You have to use only the below example to learn.
Here are some functions you can use to command the spot robot.
aw.move_spot() - moves the spot robot forward or backward.
 Example:  move_spot(self,0.5,1) function requires only 3 paramters. v_x is the linear velocity that is defaulted to 0.5 untill explicitly asked to increase the speed. duration_s is defaulted to 1.
Example 2 : move_spot(self,0.5,3)- moves the spot robot forward by 3 meters.                          
aw.sit_spot() - the standing spot robot sits.
aw.stand_spot -  the sitting spot robot stands up. 
aw.turn_spot -  rotates the spot robot right or left around its axis.
aw.stop_spot() - stops the spot from moving forward or turning.
If you are given serious of above commands then execute them like an element of a list one after the other. Making sure each command/element is executed before moving to the next command/element. 
use the below values to customize the direction and movement distance of spot robot. 
The values of "v_x", "v_y", "v_rot" is between 0 and 2.
The values of "duration_s" will be given to you. 
A few useful things: 
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
