# SPOT_ROBOT_SCRIPTS

Welcome to the SPOT_ROBOT_SCRIPTS repository! This repository hosts a collection of scripts developed for integrating Boston Dynamics SPOT robot with ROS Noetic and Python.

## About

The SPOT_ROBOT_SCRIPTS repository serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in robotics, particularly in working with Boston Dynamics SPOT robot. Leveraging ROS Noetic and Python, I've developed scripts aimed at enhancing SPOT's capabilities and integrating it into various robotic systems and environments as part of my work as Research Assistant. 

## Skills Utilized

In the development of these projects, I've leveraged a range of skills, including:

- **Python**: Python serves as the primary programming language for scripting and control logic implementation.
- **ROS Noetic**: ROS (Robot Operating System) Noetic is utilized for managing communication between different components of the robotic system.
- **Cartographer**: Cartographer, a popular ROS package, is employed for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) tasks, enabling SPOT to navigate and map its surroundings autonomously.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Natural Language Processing techniques are integrated to facilitate human-robot interaction and command interpretation.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: LLMs are used as simple API ping/response or build from the scractch and also fine tuned versions of recently added models like Llama v1.6

## Projects

At present, this repository hosts foundational scripts and projects aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of SPOT within a ROS environment. As the work progresses, I intend to expand the scope of projects to cover a broader range of functionalities and applications. Here's a brief overview of the current projects:

- **Basic Motion Control**: Implementing basic motion control scripts to maneuver SPOT within its environment.
- **Mapping and Localization**: Integration of Google Cartographer for mapping and localization tasks, enabling SPOT to navigate autonomously.
- **NLP Integration**: Incorporating NLP techniques to allow SPOT to interpret and respond to human commands more intelligently.
- **LLM Integration**: Integrating with LLM models like Chatgpt, Llama and Llava for controlling and navigating the robot and creating a VQA chatbot over real-time voice commands. 

## Future Work

In the future, I plan to expand this repository with additional projects and enhancements.
